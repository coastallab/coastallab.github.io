abstract = "Tsunamis, or “harbor waves” in Japanese, are so-named due to common observations of enhanced wave heights, currents and damage in harbors and ports. However, dynamic currents induced by these waves, while regularly observed and known to cause significant damage, are poorly understood. Observations and modeling of the currents induced by the 2011 Tohoku and 2004 Indian Ocean tsunamis allows us to show that the strongest flows in harbor basins are governed by horizontally sheared and rotational shallow features, such as jets and large eddies. When examining currents in harbors, this conclusion will generally require a simulation approach that both includes the relevant physical processes in the governing equations and uses a numerical scheme that does not artificially damp these features. Without proper representation of the physics associated with these phenomena, predictive models may provide drag force estimates that are an order of magnitude or more in error. The immediate implementation of this type of analysis into tsunami hazard studies can mean the difference between an unaffected port and one in which 300 m long container vessels are detached from their moorings and drift chaotically.

The fundamental purpose of the coupling effort is to develop the capability to seamlessly model tsunami evolution from generation to inundation with fine scale resolution, without the loss of locally important physics. The two model components are briefly introduced, and the physical mismatch between the two models is examined analytically. As coupling of numerically and physically heterogeneous models may result in undesirable errors, a general benchmark test has been undertaken to provide a parameter range for expected accuracy and stability. Long wave propagation onto a shallow shelf is simulated to validate the coupled model, examining the importance of dispersive and nonlinear effects in the nearshore area, as well as the utility of the coupled modeling system. Finally, the model is applied to the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. In this test, the local dynamics experienced in the Port of Salalah in Oman, as documented by Okal et al. (2006), are recreated. },

  abstract = {On March 11, 2011 at 5:46:23 UTC (March 10 11:46:23 PM Galapagos Local Time), the Mw 9.0 Great East Japan Earthquake occurred near the Tohoku region off the east coast of Japan, spawning a Pacific-wide tsunami. Approximately 12,000 km away, the Galapagos Islands experienced moderate tsunami impacts, including flooding, structural damage, and strong currents. In this paper, we present observations and measurements of the tsunami effects in the Galapagos, focusing on the four largest islands in the archipelago; (from west to east) Isabela, Santiagio, Santa Cruz, and San Cristobal. Access to the tsunami affected areas was one of the largest challenges of the field survey. Aside from approximately ten sandy beaches open to tourists, all other shoreline locations are restricted to anyone without a research permit; open cooperation with the Galapagos National Park provided the survey team complete access to the Islands coastlines. Survey locations were guided by numerical simulations of the tsunami performed prior to the field work. This numerical guidance accurately predicted the regions of highest impact, as well as regions of relatively low impact. Tide-corrected maximum tsunami heights were generally in the range of 3--4 m with the highest runup of 6 m measured in a small pocket beach on Isla Isabela. Puerto Ayora, on Santa Cruz Island, the largest harbor in the Galapagos experienced significant flooding and damage to structures located at the shoreline. A current meter moored inside the harbor recorded relatively weak tsunami currents of less than 0.3 m/s (0.6 knot) during the event. Comparisons with detailed numerical simulations suggest that these low current speed observations are most likely the result of data averaging at 20-min intervals and that maximum instantaneous current speeds were considerably larger. Currents in the Canal de Itabaca, a natural waterway between Santa Cruz Island and a smaller island offshore, were strong enough to displace multiple 5.5-ton navigation buoys. Numerical simulations indicate that currents in the Canal de Itabaca exceeded 4 m/s ({\textasciitilde}8 knots), a very large flow speed for a navigational waterway.},

Even without flooding, maritime assets are vulnerable to significant damage from strong currents and associated drag forces. While such impacts have been observed in the past, they have not been well studied in any context. Nearshore tsunami currents are governed by nonlinear and turbulent physics and often have large spatial and temporal variability making high-fidelity modeling particularly challenging. Furthermore, measured data for the validation of numerical simulations is limited, with few quality data sets appearing after recent tsunami events. In this paper, we present a systematic approach for the interpretation of measured tsunami-induced current impacts as well as a validation approach for simulation tools.

The comparison was focused on accurate prediction of measured wave heights. Characteristics of the three wave models were discussed and their overall predictability of the measured data was evaluated by calculating mean absolute relative errors of wave height. All the numerical models simulated fairly well shoaling and breaking of waves propagating on a plane sloping beach, but the model accuracy was somewhat degenerated in simulating waves propagating over a barred beach. Among the three models, MIKE 21 BW was the most insensitive to the bathymetric change. Combined refraction-diffraction over a shoal without breaking was quite well simulated by the models, especially by REF/DIF S and MIKE 21 BW. When waves break over the shoal, however, all the models failed to reproduce the wave field behind the shoal. The agreement with data in simulating wave diffraction around breakwater was remarkably good for MIKE 21 BW, but poor for other two models. Except the last simulation, the mean absolute relative errors of wave height from the three models ranged between 3 and 27{\%}.},

  abstract = {Abstract A set of depth-integrated equations describing combined wave–current flows is derived and validated. To account for the effect of turbulence induced by interactions between waves and currents with arbitrary horizontal vorticity, new additional stress terms are introduced. These stresses are functions of a parameter b that relates the relative importance of wave radiation stress and bottom friction stress to the wave–current interaction. To solve the equations, a fourth-order MUSCL-TVD scheme with an approximate Riemann solver is adopted. As a first-order check of the model, the Doppler shift effect and wave dispersion over linearly sheared currents are analytically shown to be retained appropriately in the equation set. The model results are then validated through comparisons with three experimental data sets. First, based on the experiments of Kemp and Simons (1982, 1983), a reasonable functional form of b is estimated. Second, simulations examining the propagation of a weakly dispersive wave over a depth-uniform or linearly sheared current are performed. Finally, the model is applied to a more complex configuration where bichromatic waves interact with spatially varying currents. Simulated results indicate that the model is capable of predicting nearshore interactions of waves with currents of arbitrary vertical structure. One of the unique properties of the developed model is its ability to assimilate an external current field from any source, be it from a circulation model or an observation, and predict the interaction of a nonlinear and dispersive wave field with that current. },

  abstract  = {We consider the change in fluid density in a depth-integrated long-wave model. By allowing horizontal and vertical variation of fluid density, a depth-integrated model for long gravity waves over a variable-density fluid has been developed, where density change effects are included as correction terms. In particular, a two-layer fluid system is chosen to represent vertical density variations, where interfacial wave effects on the free surface are accounted for through direct inclusion of the velocity component of the interfacial wave. For the numerical implementation of the model, a finite-volume scheme coupled with an approximate Riemann solver is adopted for leading-order terms while cell-centred finite-volume methods are utilized for others. Numerical tests in which the density field is configured to vary either horizontally or vertically have been performed to verify the model. For horizontal variation of fluid density, a pneumatic breakwater system is simulated and fair agreement is observed between computed and measured data, indicating that the current induced by the upward bubble flux is responsible for wave attenuation to some degree. To investigate the effects of internal motion on the free surface, a two-layer fluid system with monochromatic internal wave motion is tested numerically. Simulated results agree well with the measured and analytical data. Lastly, nonlinear interactions between external- and internal-mode surface waves are studied numerically and analytically, and the model is shown to have nonlinear accuracy limitations similar to existing Boussinesq-type models.},

Since strong and sometimes catastrophic currents are created by tsunami waves, the harbor area is also vulnerable to the morphological changes from tsunami impacts. In this study, the morphological responses to the tsunami waves are examined through numerical simulations using Xbeach model. As a real-scale implementation, 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami, one of the most destructive tsunamis in history is attempted with a focus on the localized effects of tsunami waves on sedimentation at the Crescent City Harbor. The tsunami physics are known to be less predictable in the nearshore area because of the complex geometric features and the existence of various types of turbulence sources, it is much important to recreate tsunami current field more accurately for the sediment calculations. To this end, a multi-grids and multi-physics tsunami model is preferred for the better reproduction of current fields by tsunami waves in the nearshore. Results on velocity fields computed by tsunami model show that strong and catastrophic currents with large coherent structures were induced by tsunami waves in the harbor area(Son and Lynett, 2015). Such pre-calculated wave fields during tsunami events are then input to Xbeach model to simulate sedimentation process in the area of interest. Bathymetric changes predicted by Xbeach model reveal that strong velocity fields which had been successfully generated through the tsunami model resulted severe sedimentation processes of scouring and deposition which is consistent with the observation.},

In the present study, we investigate morphological changes by far-field tsunami impacts at the US west coasts via numerical simulations. Firstly, we develop a numerical model for predicting morphological evolutions by integrating a set of sub-models; hydrodynamics, sediment transport and morphological evolution models. Particularly, fully nonlinear Boussinesq-type equations are employed in the hydrodynamic model to the accurate calculation of nearshore current fields which tend to be easily chaotic and unpredictable due to the existence of various types of turbulence sources(e.g., wave-breaking). Then, the developed model is validated through benchmark tests of one-dimensional or two-dimensional sedimentation problems; dam-break flow over the movable bed, breaking solitary waves over a sloping beach, partially breached dam-break flow over the mobile bed, and dam-break flows over a movable bed with a sudden enlargement. Throughout tests, calculated results agree well with the experimental records when a reasonable parameter is chosen for an empirical formula. Lastly, a real-scale application of the model to the 2011 Tohoku-oki tsunami is presented with the results of tsunami-generated scouring and depositon in the the Santa Cruz Harbor and in the Crescent City Harbor, CA(USA). In both locations, strong currents are successfully generated through the model and cause severe depth changes through sedimentation process. Calculated area coverages for scouring and deposition in the harbor area also agree well with observations(Figure 1).},

The hope is that the maritime guidance and associated education and outreach program will help save lives and reduce exposure of damage to boats and harbor infrastructure. An important step in this process is to understand the causative mechanism for damage in ports and harbors, and then ensure that the models used to generate hazard maps are able to accurately simulate these processes. Findings will be used to develop maps, guidance documents, and consistent policy recommendations for emergency managers and port authorities and provide information critical to real-time decisions required when responding to tsunami alert notifications. The goals of the study are to (1) evaluate the effectiveness and sensitivity of existing numerical models for assessing maritime tsunami hazards, (2) find a relationship between current speeds and expected damage levels, (3) evaluate California ports and harbors in terms of tsunami induced hazards by identifying regions that are prone to higher current speeds and damage and to identify regions of relatively lower impact that may be used for evacuation of maritime assets, and (4) determine ';safe depths' for evacuation of vessels from ports and harbors during a tsunami event. This presentation will focus on the results from five California ports and harbors, and will include feedback we have received from initial discussion with local harbor masters and port authorities. This work in California will form the basis for tsunami hazard reduction for all U.S. maritime communities through the National Tsunami Hazard Mitigation Program.},

  abstract = {In the coastal area, defined as the region between the shoreline and some offshore limit where the depth can no longer influence the waves, complex behavior of waves is anticipated due to various physical effects such as turbulence, wave-structure interaction, wave-current interaction, wave breaking and fluid-density variations. For modeling of nearshore hydrodynamics, many numerical models have been developed so far, but many of such effects are not yet considered appropriately. In this dissertation, depth-integrated numerical models used in long wave simulation are developed for better understanding of complicated hydrodynamics at the nearshore. First, a non-dispersive shallow water equation model and dispersive Boussinesq model are two-way coupled. The fundamental purpose of the coupling effort is to develop the capability to seamlessly model long wave evolution from deep to shallow water with fine scale resolution, without the loss of locally important physics. Second, a set of depthintegrated equations describing combined wave-current flows are derived mathematically and discretized numerically. To account for the effect of turbulent interaction between waves and underlying currents with arbitrary profile, new additional stresses are introduced, which represent radiation stress of waves over the ambient current field. Finally, a numerical model for gravity waves propagating over variable density fluids is developed by allowing horizontal and vertical variation of fluid density. Throughout the derivation, density change effects appear as correction terms while the internal wave effects on the free surface waves in a two-layer system are accounted for through direct inclusion of the internal wave velocity component. For each of the studied topics, numerical tests are performed to support accuracy and applicability. Consequently, we have developed a comprehensive tool for numerical simulation of complex nearshore hydrodynamics.},
